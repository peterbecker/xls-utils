Kotlin Wrapper for HSSF/XSSF
============================

This package aims to provide easier access to Excel documents when working in Kotlin. Primarily
this is done by providing higher level abstractions. While the original POI classes are powerful,
they work closely with the internal structure of the Excel documents. This library tries to
simplify the use.
