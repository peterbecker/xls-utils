Excel Libraries and Tools
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterbecker/xls-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterbecker/xls-utils)

This is (or rather 'hopefully will be') a collection of libraries and tools to work with Excel
files from Kotlin, building on the Apache POI library.

Contents:

* `kotlin-xls`: a wrapper around POI to make handling Excel files easier
* `assert-xls`: a library to validate the contents of Excel files for unit and integration testing
* `db2xls`: a command line utility to run a SQL query via JDBC and write the results into an Excel file
